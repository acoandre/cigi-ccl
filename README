This is the source distribution of the CIGI Class Library (CCL).  This library 
makes integration of CIGI into an application much easier.  More information 
about CIGI and the CCL can be found on the CIGI web site: 
	http://cigi.sourceforge.net


INSTALLATION
============

CMake
Cmake is used to build
CCL for multiple platforms. For simplicity a number of scripts are provided in
the ccl directory for building the most common build targets.

Windows systems
---------------

The CCL can be compiled as a DLL or as a static LIB.  The following scripts can be used to build common Visual Studio targets:

	cmake_generate_vc2010_win32.bat
	cmake_generate_vc2017_x64.bat
	cmake_generate_vc2010_x64.bat
	cmake_generate_vc2013_win32.bat
	cmake_generate_vc2013_x64.bat 
	cmake_generate_vc2015_win32.bat
	cmake_generate_vc2015_x64.bat
	cmake_generate_vc2017_win32.bat

To build with examples or non-standard build options (e.g. with exception handling disabled) cmake gui should be run and the required CCL options set before generating the project and building the solution manually (alternatively a custom script could be written to do this using cmake).

UNIX systems
------------

The following scripts can be used to build the standard makefile output:

	cmake_generate_linux.sh

This will create the output files in _linux\lib.


USAGE
=====

API Documentation
-----------------

Documentation for the CCL API is available from the CIGI web site, and in the 
form of Doxygen-generated help files.

pkg-config
----------

If you are building a program that uses the CIGI Class Library, and you are 
using a modern UNIX-like system, you may be able to take advantage of the 
'pkg-config' utility.  The CCL includes a configuration file for pkg-config, 
and this file is installed by default when you run 'make install'.  If your 
system has pkg-config installed, you can build CCL programs using a series of 
commands similar to the following:

cc `pkg-config --cflags cigicl` ...etc...
cc `pkg-config --libs cigicl` *.o ...etc...

This makes your Makefiles much more readable, and saves you time spent 
tracking down the location of header and library files.  You can get more info 
on pkg-config by running 'man pkg-config'.
